It's pretty easy to deal with simple questions like 

> If your energy is less than 10, show message "You are low on energy".

But you will need to ask more interesting questions like

> If energy is less than 10 **AND** steps taken is greater than 20, show message "You are doing really badly".

or

> If maze height is less than 5 **OR** maze width < 8, show message "The maze is a bit small".

This is very easy to code in Javascript.
