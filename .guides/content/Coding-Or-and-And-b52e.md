> If energy is less than 10 **AND** steps taken is greater than 20, show message "You are doing really badly".

is written like this

```javascript
if (energy < 10 && steps > 20) {
  showMessage('You are doing really badly')
}
```

So, `&&` is the way you write **AND**.


> If maze height is less than 5 **OR** maze width < 8, show message "The maze is a bit small".

is written like this

```javascript
if (mazeHeight < 5 || mazeWidth > 8) {
  showMessage('The maze is a bit small')
}
```

So, `||` is the way you write **OR**.
