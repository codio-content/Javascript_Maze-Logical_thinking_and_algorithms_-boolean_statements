Each time you press the A it 'toggles' between the arrow working and not working.\n\n**Hint** you can change the value of a boolean to `false` when `true` or `true` when `false` using `boolVar = !boolVar`.\n",

You need to \n\n- Create the boolean variable `allowOtherKeys` and set its value to `true`\n- Insert an `if` statement that checks whether it is true\n- If it is true, then the keyboard handler should run so the 'A' moves the player left, 'D' moves right, 'W' up and 'S' down. You should insert the correct keyboard characters as upper case letters.\n\nYou will end up with an `if` within another `if` (a nested `if` statement). Don't forget the `{}` brackets.\n\nIndent your code neatly so the nested `if` is indented. You can do this quickly by highlighting multiple lines of code and then pressing the TAB key to indent or Shift+TAB to outdent.\n",
